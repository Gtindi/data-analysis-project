## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This README describes work done on the Tips Dataset for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module assessment due November 29 2019. Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and run Jupyter notebook which comes as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python (as do the other packages listed above). The Tips dataset is incuded in the Seaborn visualization library and can be loaded provided one has access to the internet. For the sake of completeness, I downloaded the dataset from the site included in the project instructions and I include it in this repository as a csv file.
