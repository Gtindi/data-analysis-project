## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This README describes work done on the Tips data set for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module assessment due 29 November 2019. Resources used include Python and associated packages Jupyter, matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename given above. To view this file, download it from this repository and run Jupyter notebook, which comes as part of the Anaconda distribution of Python (as do the other packages listed above). Alternatively, view a static version of the notebook (by providing its GitHub url) using Jupyter Nbviewer. The Tips data set is incuded in the Seaborn visualization library. It can be loaded provided one has access to the internet when running the notebook. For the sake of completeness, I have downloaded the data set from the site referenced in the project instructions, and I include it in this repository as a csv file.

##  Description of the data set <a name="section1"></a>
The Tips data set contains 244 rows of data relating to tips left in a restaurant. It includes the total bill, tip, number in the party, day of week, time of day, gender of the diner, and whether or not they are a smoker. I would say that the basic question is: does the tip amount depend on the total bill? One can also ask if the other variables influence the tip left. This will be addressed in section 3. <!--put in a ref-->
I often use sites such as Medium.com to see how other people have investigated data sets using Python.Two examples of such exploratory data analysis are given in the reference list. The very first step is always to check if the data needs cleaning by looking for duplicate rows, zero values or NaNs where they shouldn't be, etc. Our data set is small enough to inspect visually and it looks fine.
